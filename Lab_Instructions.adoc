= Accelerating Application Design With OpenAPI

## Getting The Tools

Before you begin, you will need to ensure that your development environment is properly configured. To make that happen you will want certain tools installed and usable. Most of this tutorial will assume a UNIX-like environment (MacOS, Linux, WSL2).

* Install http://www.nodejs.org/[NodeJS]
* Install a https://adoptopenjdk.net/[Java Virtual Machine]

## Conference Wifi Sucks!

We know, usually the conference wifi is so bad that you cannot actually download dependencies and whatnot. We've thought of that. Connect to the `REDHAT-CNAD` or `REDHAT-CNAD-5G` SSID. There is no password. When you're on that network, we are providing a NPM Proxy/Cache you can configure as follows:

```
mkdir -p /path/for/new/project
npm config -L project set registry http://nexus3.cpl:8081/repository/npm-proxy/
```

This will ensure that any projects you create starting in that directory will use our local Nexus Repository cache. We have pre-seeded all of the most important libraries for Quasar and this Vue application. If you choose to use a different toolkit, only the first copy will be downloaded and subsequent copies will come from the cache.

## Bootstrap Your Project

* Create your new project. We will be creating a household bills manager and cash flow analyzer
** `npm init quasar`
* Change to the new project directory
** `cd todo-quasar-openapi`
* Add Dev dependencies
** `npm i --save-dev @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli @stoplight/prism-cli npm-watch`

<<<

* Create a basic OpenAPI contract

[source,yaml]

TIP: This is a reasonable start for any new REST API contract

* Add new scripts to `package.json`

[source,json]
----
"watch": "npm-watch",
"prism": "prism mock -d --cors -p 7080 openapi.yml",
"openapi": "openapi-generator-cli generate -g typescript-axios -i openapi.yml -o src/sdk/ -p withSeparateModelsAndApi=true,apiPackage=api,modelPackage=models"
----

//

* Add `watch` block to `package.json` after the `scripts` block

[source,json]
----
"watch": {
  "openapi": {
    "patterns": [     <1>
      "openapi.yml",
      "package.json"
    ],
    "inherit": true
  },
  "prism": true,      <2>
  "serve": {
    "patterns": [     <3>
      "package-lock.json",
      "package.json",
      "tsconfig.json",
      "quasar.config.js"
    ],
    "inherit": true
  }
},
----
<1> When either `openapi.yml` or `package.json` change, regenerate the OpenAPI Client code
<2> Ensure that the `prism` mock API server is running. It will automatically detect changes in the OpenAPI file.
<3> When any of the core framework files change, restart the development web server

[IMPORTANT]
What did I just accomplish?
====
You have just created a new project using the https://quasar.dev/[Quasar] framework for https://v3.vuejs.org/[VueJS]. You also added tooling which will allow you to both create a Mock API server (using Prism) but also generate the code which allows you to talk to that API automatically. As we proceed, you will see that when we need a new data type or new API method, we can quickly add it to the `openapi.yml` file and the `npm-watch` tool will automatically regenerate the necessary code and restart the necessary services.

## Open your project in your preferred IDE

These are IDE's I have had good luck with

* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode]
* https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm]

## Start Building Todo User Interface

* We know that we're going to need a Todo object type, so let's create that in the `openapi.yml`

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  schemas:
    NewTodo:
      type: object
      required:
      - title
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
          maxLength: 255
        description:
          type: string
        id:
          type: string
          format: uuid
----

* That will be a good object definition for when we are creating a new Todo item, but we also want some validation, so let's create a `Todo` type which has some required fields:

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  schemas:
    Todo:
      type: object
      required:
      - title
      - id
      allOf:
      - $ref: '#/components/schemas/NewTodo'
----

<<<

* Let's add a new endpoint to let us get the complete list of Todos

[source,yaml]
----
tags:
  - name: api
  - name: todo    # <1>
paths:
  /todos:
    get:
      description: Get all todos
      operationId: getAllTodos    # <2>
      tags:
        - todo
      responses:
        '200':
          description: 'OK'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Todo'
----
<1> The tag becomes the name of the API object for this tag
<2> The `operationId` becomes the method name in the API object to call in order to access that endpoint

<<<

* Once we add these, save the file and start our `watch` script

[NOTE]
*What is happening here?
====
By defining the `NewTodo` and `Todo` schemas along with the `/todo` **GET** operation in the `openapi.yml` file and starting the watch, prism and openapi-generator start up the mock API server and generate the client-side code for talking to the API. The API client code can be found in `src/sdk` and we will use it to talk to the mock API as we develop the user interface application.
